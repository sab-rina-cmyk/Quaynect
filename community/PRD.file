## 1. Design System & UI Guidelines
**Core Philosophy:** A clean, accessible mobile-first interface using Tailwind CSS.

### 1.1 Color Palette (Strict Adherence)
* **Primary Blue:** `#3B82F6` (Tailwind `bg-primary` / `text-primary`)
* **Primary Dark:** `#2563EB` (Tailwind `bg-primary-dark`)
* **Backgrounds:**
    * Light Mode: `#F3F4F6` (`bg-background-light`)
    * Dark Mode: `#111827` (`bg-background-dark`)
* **Cards/Surfaces:**
    * Light Mode: `#FFFFFF` (`bg-card-light`)
    * Dark Mode: `#1F2937` (`bg-card-dark`)

### 1.2 Typography & Shapes
* **Font:** "Inter", sans-serif.
* **Icons:** Material Icons Round & Material Symbols Rounded.
* **Border Radius:** `rounded-2xl` (1rem) for cards; `rounded-full` for buttons/chips.

### 1.3 Container "Safe Zones" (CRITICAL)
* **The "Breathing Room" Rule:** ANY container that scrolls or contains interactive elements (shadows/hover lifts) MUST have internal padding.
    * **Horizontal Lists:** MUST have `pt-4` (top padding) to prevent hover-lift clipping.
    * **Grids/cards:** MUST have `pb-8` (bottom padding) to prevent shadow clipping.
    * **Never** rely on margins for these safe zones.

### 1.4 Advanced Motion & Interactions
* **Card Hover:** Lift (`-translate-y-1`) + Blue Ring (`ring-2 ring-primary`) + Shadow (`shadow-lg`).
* **Page Transitions (Morphs):**
    * **Type:** Container Transform (Shared Element).
    * **Behavior:** When a Category Card (e.g., Groups) is clicked, the Detail View MUST appear to expand from that card's position.
    * **Anchor Points:** Use `transform-origin` matching the card's location (e.g., `top left` for the first card) to create a "stretching" effect.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 File Structure (SPA)
* **Single File System:** All views MUST reside in `index.html`. Do NOT create separate HTML files.
* **View Management:** Views are separated by HTML Comments (``) and toggled using the `hidden` class.

### 2.2 Navigation & Overlays
* **Detail Views:** All secondary screens (Groups, Events) must be **Fixed Overlays**.
    * **Class Requirement:** `fixed inset-0 z-50 bg-background-light overflow-y-auto`.
    * **Why?** This prevents the expanded view from pushing the home content down.
